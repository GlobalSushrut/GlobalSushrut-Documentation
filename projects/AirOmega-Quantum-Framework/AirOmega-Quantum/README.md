## 📘 Overview

The AirOmega Quantum Tree Tunnel System is a novel framework for exploring quantum state evolution through a tree-based structure that models multi-path quantum dynamics. It implements a mathematical foundation based on complex trigonometric functions, providing a geometrical representation of quantum states with bounded energy constraints.

This framework allows researchers to:

- Explore quantum evolution paths through a tree-based structure
- Classify quantum states based on their energy norms
- Identify stable ("clean") evolution paths
- Model entangled quantum systems with joint constraints
- Visualize quantum dynamics and pathways

## 🧮 Mathematical Foundation

### Omega Function

The core of the system is based on the complex omega function:

```
ω(x) = cos⁻¹(x) + i·log(x + ε)
```

Where ε is a small positive constant (e.g., 1e-6) to prevent logarithmic singularity.

### Trio Spinor Vector

For any angle triple (θ, φ, ψ), we define the AirOmega spin vector:

```
T_Ω = [tan(θ)·ω(θ), tan(φ)·ω(φ), tan(ψ)·ω(ψ)]
```

### Energy Constraint

We impose a bounded constraint on the total energy:

```
‖T_Ω‖² < 2 = 2!
```

This ensures quantum stability and provides a natural classification boundary.

## 🌲 Tree Tunnel System

The Tree Tunnel System represents a quantum evolution model where:

- Each node corresponds to a quantum state defined by the angles (θ, φ, ψ)
- Nodes are classified based on their norm:
  - **Clean**: < 1.5
  - **Damped**: 1.5 – 2.0
  - **Collapse**: ≥ 2.0
  - **Invalid**: NaN or math exception
- The tree structure allows finding the longest chain of clean nodes (safe evolution)

## 🧠 Entangled System Extension

For 2-qubit systems, each qubit has its own AirOmega vector (T_1, T_2) with a joint norm constraint:

```
‖T_1 + T_2‖² < 2
```

This models entangled quantum evolution with bounded interference.

# Build the tree and find the longest clean path
tree.build_tree()
longest_path = tree.find_longest_clean_path()

# Visualize the tree
tree.visualize_tree(filename="tree_tunnel.png")

# Run quantum circuit simulations

    delta=0.3,
    max_depth=3,
    expand_method="alternating"
)

# Build the tree and find paths
tree.build_tree()
path = tree.find_longest_clean_path()
