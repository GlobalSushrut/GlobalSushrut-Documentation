# What We Made

## General AI Agent with Enhanced Capabilities

We've successfully built a General AI Agent that extends OpenHands/OpenDevin's capabilities with sophisticated AI components. Our agent integrates with OpenHands while adding several advanced features that significantly enhance its capabilities.

## Core Components

### Task Planner
- **MockGraph Task Decomposition**: Breaks down complex tasks into steps with explicit dependencies
- **Parallel Execution Support**: Identifies which steps can be executed simultaneously
- **Retrograde Learning**: Improves planning based on past successes and failures

### UI Abstraction Layer
- **Non-Euclidean Tensor Abstraction**: Mathematical representation of UI elements
- **Entropy Tracking**: Handles uncertainty in UI element positions
- **Advanced Path Planning**: Optimizes cursor movements for interaction

### Cursor Controller
- **Computer Vision Integration**: Detects and interacts with visual interface elements
- **Multi-Step Action Sequences**: Executes complex UI workflows with retry strategies
- **Error Recovery**: Adapts to UI changes and inconsistencies

### Skill Tree Logger
- **Retrograde Causal Trees**: Tracks relationships between actions and outcomes
- **Success/Failure Pattern Recognition**: Identifies patterns across multiple sessions
- **Execution Tracing**: Follows the execution path to diagnose issues

### Ethical Middleware
- **Policy Enforcement Engine**: Validates actions against configurable ethical rules
- **Compliance Reporting**: Generates reports on policy adherence
- **Violation Prevention**: Blocks potentially harmful operations

### Notebook Memory
- **Jupyter-Style Execution Logs**: Creates rich, interactive execution history
- **Editable Records**: Allows modification and annotation of execution logs
- **Export Capabilities**: Supports various output formats (markdown, notebooks)

### RAG Engine
- **Cross-Session Memory**: Maintains knowledge across separate coding sessions
- **Semantic Retrieval**: Finds similar past tasks based on meaning, not just keywords
- **Knowledge Reuse**: Leverages previous solutions to avoid redundant work

### Windsurf Connector
- **OpenHands Integration**: Connects our agent to the OpenHands/OpenDevin platform
- **Docker Support**: Works with containerized instances of OpenHands
- **API Compatibility**: Translates between our agent's components and OpenHands

## Integration Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture where:

1. The **Windsurf Connector** serves as the bridge to OpenHands
2. The **Task Planner** breaks down user requests into executable steps
3. The **Ethical Middleware** validates all operations against policy rules
4. The **Skill Tree** and **Notebook Memory** record execution for future reference
5. The **RAG Engine** retrieves relevant past knowledge
6. The **UI Abstraction** and **Cursor Controller** handle interactions with visual interfaces

This architecture allows our agent to enhance OpenHands with sophisticated AI capabilities while maintaining compatibility with its core functionality.
