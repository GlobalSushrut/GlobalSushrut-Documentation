# AGI Toolkit Example Applications

This directory contains example applications demonstrating how to use the AGI Toolkit in real-world scenarios. These examples show how you can build powerful applications on top of ASI and MOCK-LLM components without modifying the core implementation code.

## Available Examples

### Text Analysis Application

A comprehensive text analysis tool that demonstrates:
- Sentiment analysis with MOCK-LLM
- Advanced text processing with ASI
- Data persistence using the unified memory system
- Command-line interface for seamless interaction

**Usage:**

```bash
cd text_analysis
python app.py --analyze "This is a sample text to analyze"
```

Or use the interactive mode:

```bash
cd text_analysis
python app.py
```

### Simple Chatbot

A conversational AI application that shows:
- How to build a chat interface
- Maintaining conversation context
- Leveraging both ASI and MOCK-LLM capabilities
- Graceful degradation when components are unavailable

**Usage:**

```bash
cd simple_chatbot
python chatbot.py
```

For non-interactive use:

```bash
cd simple_chatbot
python chatbot.py --input "Tell me about quantum computing"
```

## Building Your Own Applications

These examples are meant to serve as starting points for your own custom applications. Here are some tips for creating your own applications:

1. **Start with the simplified API**: The `AGIAPI` class provides a high-level interface that abstracts away the implementation details.

2. **Handle component availability**: Always check for component availability using `api.has_asi` and `api.has_mock_llm` before using specific functionality.

3. **Use error handling**: Implement proper error handling to create resilient applications.

4. **Leverage the unified memory**: Use the memory system for maintaining state across sessions.
