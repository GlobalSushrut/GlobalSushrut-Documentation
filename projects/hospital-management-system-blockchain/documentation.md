## Introduction

The Hospital Management System (HMS) is a comprehensive healthcare platform designed to streamline hospital operations, enhance patient care, and secure medical records through blockchain technology. This documentation provides detailed information for developers, administrators, and end users.

## System Components

### Flask Backend

The backend is built on Python's Flask framework, offering RESTful APIs for all system functionalities:

- **Authentication Service**: Handles user login, registration, and authorization
- **Patient Management**: APIs for creating and managing patient records
- **Appointment System**: Scheduling and management of patient appointments
- **Billing Service**: Processing payments and generating invoices
- **Telemedicine Service**: Video consultation and chat functionality
- **Pharmacy Module**: Prescription management and drug inventory
- **Analytics Engine**: Data analytics and reporting tools

### React Frontend

The frontend is built with React and Material-UI, providing a responsive interface for different user roles:

- **Patient Portal**: Access to medical records, appointments, and payments
- **Doctor Dashboard**: Patient management, appointment scheduling, and prescription writing
- **Admin Panel**: System configuration, user management, and analytics
- **Pharmacy Interface**: Medication management and prescription fulfillment
- **Laboratory Module**: Test ordering and result management

### Rust Secure Database

A custom-built database solution in Rust that provides:

- High-performance data storage and retrieval

- `POST /api/auth/forgot-password`: Password reset
- `GET /api/auth/verify/{token}`: Email verification

### Patient Endpoints

- `GET /api/patients`: List patients (admin/doctor)
- `GET /api/patients/{id}`: Get patient details
- `POST /api/patients`: Create new patient
- `PUT /api/patients/{id}`: Update patient information
- `DELETE /api/patients/{id}`: Remove patient record

### Appointment Endpoints

- `GET /api/appointments`: List appointments
- `POST /api/appointments`: Create appointment
- `PUT /api/appointments/{id}`: Update appointment
- `DELETE /api/appointments/{id}`: Cancel appointment

### Complete API documentation is available at `/api/docs` when the system is running.

## Blockchain Integration

### MediChain Implementation

The MediChain blockchain is a custom Polygon sidechain designed specifically for medical record storage. Key components include:

1. **Record Storage**:
   - Medical records are encrypted and stored on-chain
   - Only hash references are stored for large files (images, etc.)
   - Patient controls access permissions

2. **Smart Contracts**:
   - `PatientConsent.sol`: Manages patient consent for data access
   - `MedicalRecord.sol`: Handles the storage and retrieval of records
   - `AccessControl.sol`: Manages permissions for healthcare providers

3. **Integration Points**:
   - `blockchain_service.py`: Backend service for blockchain communication
   - Web3.js integration in the frontend for direct blockchain interaction

### Hospital Blockchain Implementation

The Hospital Blockchain is a Geth-based Ethereum-compatible chain for financial transactions:

1. **Financial Contracts**:
   - `Billing.sol`: Handles patient billing and payments
   - `Insurance.sol`: Processes insurance claims and verifications
   - `ServicePayment.sol`: Manages payments for medical services

2. **Integration**:
   - RESTful API endpoints for blockchain transactions
   - Event listeners for transaction confirmations
   - Admin dashboard for blockchain monitoring

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection

1. **Encryption**:
   - End-to-end encryption for all sensitive data
   - AES-256 encryption for data at rest
   - TLS/SSL for data in transit

2. **Access Control**:
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Time-limited access tokens
   - Multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations

3. **Audit Trail**:
   - Comprehensive logging of all system activities
   - Blockchain verification of data access
   - Regular security audits and compliance checks
