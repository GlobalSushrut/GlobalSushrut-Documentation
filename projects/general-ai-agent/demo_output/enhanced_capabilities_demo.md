# Execution Log: Build a REST API for...

Build a REST API for a task management system

## Step: Understand Requirements

ID: `step_1`

Analyze and understand the requirements of the task



```python
# Action: 
{}
```

**Output:**

```
# Result: Success
Successfully executed step: Understand Requirements

```json
{
  "execution_time": 10.5
}
```
```

## Step: Set Up Environment

ID: `step_2`

Set up the development environment and dependencies



```python
# Action: setup_environment
{
  "type": "setup_environment",
  "commands": [
    "install_dependencies",
    "initialize_project"
  ]
}
```

**Output:**

```
# Result: Success
Successfully executed step: Set Up Environment

```json
{
  "execution_time": 10.5
}
```
```

## Step: Implement Core Functionality

ID: `step_3`

Implement the core functionality required by the task



```python
# Write Code

```

**Output:**

```
# Result: Success
Successfully executed step: Implement Core Functionality

```json
{
  "execution_time": 10.5
}
```
```

## Step: Test Implementation

ID: `step_4`

Test the implemented functionality to ensure it works correctly



```python
# Action: test_code
{
  "type": "test_code",
  "commands": [
    "run_tests",
    "verify_output"
  ]
}
```

**Output:**

```
# Result: Failure
Failed to execute step: Test Implementation

```json
{
  "error": "Some error occurred"
}
```
```

## Step: Refine and Optimize

ID: `step_5`

Refine and optimize the implementation based on test results



```python
# Action: refine_code
{
  "type": "refine_code",
  "files": [
    "main.py",
    "utils.py"
  ]
}
```

**Output:**

```
# Result: Success
Successfully executed step: Refine and Optimize

```json
{
  "execution_time": 10.5
}
```
```

## Conclusion

This demo has showcased six key capabilities that our General AI Agent adds to Windsurf/OpenDevin:

1. **Enhanced Task Planning** with MockGraph for better dependency management and execution
2. **Ethical Middleware** to enforce policies and prevent harmful operations
3. **Non-Euclidean Tensor Abstraction** for sophisticated UI interaction
4. **Retrograde Learning** with skill trees to learn from failures
5. **RAG-based Retrieval** to leverage past similar tasks
6. **Notebook-style Memory** for rich execution logs

These capabilities significantly enhance Windsurf/OpenDevin's functionality, making it more
powerful, ethical, and capable of learning from past experiences.
