## EntroOS Mathematical System Performance Summary

### Mathematical Formulations Validated:
1. **Resource Allocation Formula**: Implemented and tested via the supply chain routing
   - `EffectiveResource(node,t) = [BaseAllocation + (EntropyScore(node) × NetworkContribution(node,t))] × U(node,t)`

2. **Entropy-Weighted Consensus**: Applied in verification confidence scoring
   - `VoteWeight(node,t) = [EntropyScore(node) × ReliabilityScore(node,t) × StakeAmount(node)] / (1 + DecayFactor × InactivityTime(node))`

3. **Zero-Knowledge Proof Validation**: Successfully implemented in supply chain verification
   - `Proof = ZKP_Exec(input_commit, wasm_hash, output_commit, nonce)`

4. **Entropy-Weighted Routing**: Demonstrated in product data routing
   - `RouteWeight(edge_ij,t) = BaseWeight / (Entropy(node_i) × Entropy(node_j) × Availability(edge_ij,t))`

### System Benefits Demonstrated:
- **Mathematical Verification**: Supply chain integrity verified using entropy-based confidence scoring
- **Privacy Preservation**: Zero-knowledge proofs allow verification without revealing sensitive data
- **Tamper Detection**: Broken chain links immediately detected through mathematical validation
- **Optimal Routing**: Entropy-weighted routing provides efficient data transmission paths
