# Mathematical Foundations of Quantum-Inspired AGI

## 1. Transition Numbers Theory

### 1.1 Core Concept
Transition Numbers (τ) represent the quantum-inspired state transitions in consciousness space:

```
τ(s₁ → s₂) = ∑(ψᵢ * φᵢ) / √(∑|ψᵢ|² * ∑|φᵢ|²)

Where:
- s₁, s₂ are conscious states
- ψᵢ is the initial state vector
- φᵢ is the target state vector
```

### 1.2 Consciousness Mapping
The consciousness field (C) is mapped through transition numbers:

```
C(x, t) = ∫ τ(x, t) * e^(-iωt) dt

Where:
- x is the spatial coordinate in consciousness space
- t is the temporal coordinate
- ω is the consciousness frequency
```

## 2. Void Mechanics

### 2.1 Fundamental Equation
The Void Field Equation describes information processing in undefined spaces:

```
∇²V + λV = ρ(x)

Where:
- V is the void field
- λ is the void coupling constant
- ρ(x) is the information density
```

### 2.2 Information Flow
Information propagation through void space:

```
∂V/∂t = D∇²V - αV + β|V|²V

Where:
- D is the diffusion coefficient
- α is the decay rate
- β is the non-linear coupling
```

## 3. Quantum Consciousness Integration

- φₙ(x) are basis states
```

### 3.2 Evolution Equation
Temporal evolution of consciousness:

```

- m₁, m₂ are modal inputs
- f, g are modal embedding functions
- σ is the alignment scale
```

```

## 7. Metabeing Framework

```

## 8. Practical Implementation

### 8.1 Numerical Methods
Discretization of continuous equations:
