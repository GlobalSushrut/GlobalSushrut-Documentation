The Hospital Management System consists of:

1. **Frontend**: React-based UI with enhanced components:
   - BlockchainMarketplace with tabs for Medical Products, Pharmacy Products, Lab Tests, and Doctors
   - DoctorProfile with advanced telemedicine capabilities
   - MedicalRecordsViewer with blockchain verification
   - DicomViewerPage for medical imaging

2. **Backend**: API services with routes for:
   - TenantUsageLog management
   - TenantInvoice processing
   - BlockchainNode provisioning and management
   - RustSecureDatabase integration

3. **Blockchain**: Ethereum-based nodes for secure medical record management
   - Multi-node configuration for high availability
   - Security monitoring for compliance
   - Smart contracts for medical records and prescriptions

## Pre-Deployment Validation

Before deploying to the cloud, you should validate that all system components are ready:

```bash
# Navigate to the validation scripts directory
cd validation-scripts

# Run the main validation script
./run-all-validations.sh
```

The validation checks:
- Frontend components and their features
- Backend API endpoints and authentication mechanisms
- Blockchain node configuration and connectivity
- Kubernetes deployment files

## Cloud Deployment

The deployment process automates the setup of your Hospital Management System in the cloud:

```bash
# Navigate to the cloud deployment directory
cd cloud-deployment

# Make the deployment script executable
chmod +x deploy.sh

# Run the deployment script
./deploy.sh
```

The deployment script will:
1. Run validation checks to ensure system readiness
2. Configure cloud provider credentials
3. Set up or connect to a Kubernetes cluster
4. Update Kubernetes configuration files with appropriate image references
5. Deploy all components in the correct order
6. Provide access information for the deployed services

## Supported Cloud Providers

The deployment script supports multiple cloud providers:
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Microsoft Azure
- DigitalOcean
- Custom providers (with manual configuration)

## Real-Time Development Mode

The deployment includes an option to set up real-time development, allowing you to:
- Make code changes locally
- See changes reflected in the cloud environment immediately
- Debug and test without redeploying the entire system

To use this feature, select the real-time development option during deployment, or run:

```bash
skaffold dev
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, verify that all components are working correctly:

1. Access the frontend URL provided in the deployment output
2. Verify that you can log in and access all features
3. Test the marketplace functionality
4. Verify telemedicine capabilities
5. Test blockchain integration for medical records

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during deployment:

1. Check the deployment logs in `cloud-deployment/logs/`
2. Verify Kubernetes pod status with `kubectl get pods -n hospital-system`
3. View pod logs with `kubectl logs -f &lt;pod-name&gt; -n hospital-system`
4. Run the validation scripts again to identify specific issues

## Security Considerations

The Hospital Management System is designed with security in mind:
- JWT authentication for API access
- Multi-tenant isolation for data security
- Blockchain verification for medical records
- Secure container configurations
- Resource limits and constraints

## Need Help?

If you need assistance with deployment or encounter any issues, refer to the access-info.txt file generated during deployment for detailed information about your setup.

* Jitsi Meet is integrated for secure video conferencing.
* The setup requires multi-server support and successful integration.
* Obtain your own Jitsi Meet API keys and configure them accordingly.

### 3. **Chat Module**

* Real-time chat messages are stored locally in memory.
* Chat history is maintained within the running Flask terminal.

### 4. **Payment Processing (Stripe)**

* Stripe payment processing is integrated.
* The routes are successfully triggered.
* After registering a business and linking a bank account, proper Stripe APIs will be incorporated into the existing functions in `app.py` (Stripe section).

### 5. **Blockchain-Based Data Storage**

* The system employs a **JSON-based blockchain** as a decentralized database.
* Each registered user has a dedicated block that securely stores:
  * Appointments
  * Bookings
  * Prescriptions
  * Invoices

## Installation & Setup
