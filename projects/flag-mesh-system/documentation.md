# Flag Mesh System - Documentation

## Overview

The Flag Mesh System is a production-grade feature flagging system designed with a focus on modularity, security, and scalability. It provides a robust infrastructure for managing feature flags with cryptographic validation, ensuring the integrity and security of feature configurations.

## System Architecture

The Flag Mesh System consists of four main components:

1. **Flag Engine**: Manages feature flag configurations and publishes flag states to Redis
2. **Router**: Routes requests to appropriate feature containers based on flag configurations
3. **Merkle Validator**: Provides cryptographic validation of feature flags using Merkle trees
4. **YAML Locker**: Creates and verifies lock files for configuration integrity

### Communication Flow

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│ Flag Engine │◄───►│    Redis    │◄───►│   Router    │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
       ▲                   ▲                   ▲
       │                   │                   │
       ▼                   ▼                   ▼
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│    YAML     │     │   Merkle    │     │   Feature   │
│   Locker    │     │  Validator  │     │ Containers  │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
```

- **Flag Engine** loads configurations from YAML files and publishes to Redis
- **Router** subscribes to Redis for flag state updates and routes requests
- **Merkle Validator** creates Merkle trees and publishes roots to Redis
- **YAML Locker** creates lock files with Merkle root integration

## Configuration

Feature flags are configured in YAML files located in the `config` directory. Example format:

```yaml
feature_x:
  rollout: "10%"
  container: "feature_x_container"
  mesh_proof: true
  endpoint: "http://localhost:8081"
  db: "feature_x_db"
```

## Security Features

The Flag Mesh System includes several security features:

1. **Merkle Tree Validation**: Cryptographically validates feature flag configurations
2. **Locked Configurations**: Prevents unauthorized changes through YAML lock files
3. **Rollout Controls**: Gradual feature releases with percentage-based rollouts
4. **Health Monitoring**: Active monitoring of feature flags and containers

## API Endpoints

### Flag Engine API (Port 8071)

- `GET /api/v1/flags`: List all feature flags
- `GET /api/v1/flags/{flag_name}`: Get specific flag details
- `GET /api/v1/health`: Health check endpoint

### Router API (Port 9071)

- `GET /feature/{feature_name}/...`: Route requests to feature containers
- `GET /health`: Health check endpoint

## Redis Schema

- `feature-configs`: JSON map of flag configurations
- `merkle:root`: Current Merkle root for validation
- Channel `flag-states`: Notification channel for configuration updates

## Deployment

The system is designed to be deployed in a containerized environment such as Kubernetes. Each component can be scaled independently as needed.

## Monitoring

The system exposes health endpoints for monitoring. In a production environment, these endpoints should be integrated with monitoring solutions such as Prometheus and Grafana.

## Error Handling

The system includes robust error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes and detailed error messages. All errors are logged for troubleshooting.

## Limitations

- Feature containers must be running for the Router to successfully route requests
- Merkle validation requires Redis to be available

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with external identity providers for user authentication
- Enhanced analytics for feature flag usage
- A/B testing capabilities
- Admin UI for managing feature flags
