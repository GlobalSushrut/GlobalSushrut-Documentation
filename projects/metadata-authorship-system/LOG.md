# AI Authorship Detection System Development Log

## Project Summary

We've built a production-grade Metadata-Based AI Authorship Detection System that uses multiple techniques to detect and verify AI-generated content. The system consists of several interconnected microservices that work together to provide robust detection capabilities.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Core Microservices

| Service | Language | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **metadata_collector** | Go | Captures comprehensive metadata during content generation including timing data, source information, and content hashes |
| **merkle_hasher** | Go | Creates cryptographic proofs using Merkle trees to ensure tamper-proof verification |
| **rag_store_cassandra** | Go | Stores the complete lineage graph in a Cassandra database for content traceability |
| **redis_engine** | Go | Provides fast, real-time lookups for verification based on content hashes or Merkle roots |
| **fingerprint_classifier** | Python | ML-based detection of AI-generated content using metadata patterns |
| **api_layer** | Python | Unified RESTful API and web interface for verification and tracing |

### 2. System Features

- **Metadata Capture**: Collects metadata during content generation
- **Cryptographic Verification**: Uses Merkle trees for tamper-proof content verification
- **Lineage Tracking**: Maintains a directed acyclic graph (DAG) for content origins
- **Real-Time Verification**: Fast lookups through Redis caching
- **Machine Learning Classification**: Detects AI-generated content patterns
- **Mock Mode**: Demo capability that simulates the full system functionality for testing

### 3. API Endpoints

- **`/api/v1/verify`**: Verifies content authenticity and determines AI vs. human origin
- **`/api/v1/trace`**: Traces the lineage of content through the system
- **`/api/v1/submit`**: Submits new content and metadata to the system

## Development Milestones

1. **Initial Architecture Design**: Designed the overall system architecture with microservices
2. **Core Services Implementation**: Implemented all necessary microservices
3. **API Layer Development**: Created a unified API for client applications
4. **Web Interface**: Built a user-friendly web interface for content verification
5. **Demo Mode**: Added mock functionality for demonstration without backend services
6. **Deployment Configuration**: Set up Docker Compose for easy deployment
7. **Management Scripts**: Added utility scripts for system startup and management

## Recent Updates (May 12, 2025)

### Added Mock Mode for Demonstrations

- Implemented a mock data system for the API layer that simulates responses from all microservices
- Created pre-registered content examples for direct verification matches
- Added pattern recognition for detecting AI content without exact metadata matches
- Simulated lineage data for content tracing demonstrations
- Set up environment variable configuration (`MOCK_MODE=always|auto|never`)

### Created Demonstration Tools

1. **Interactive CLI Demo** (`scripts/run_demo.py`)
   - Tests various verification scenarios
   - Shows content lineage tracing
   - Displays formatted results in the terminal

2. **System Management Script** (`start.sh`)
   - Provides easy commands for starting/stopping the system
   - Monitors service health
   - Includes log viewing capabilities
   - Starts demo applications

## Testing Status

The system successfully demonstrates the following capabilities:

- ✅ Direct verification of registered AI content
- ✅ Pattern-based detection of unregistered AI content 
- ✅ Human content detection
- ✅ Content lineage tracing
- ✅ Web interface for interactive testing
