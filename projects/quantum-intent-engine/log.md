# Quantum Intent Engine Simulation Log

## Hardware Integration: IBM Brisbane

This log documents the integration of real quantum hardware calibration data from the IBM Brisbane quantum processor and the simulation results.

### Hardware Characteristics

The IBM Brisbane quantum processor has the following key characteristics:

#### Qubit Properties
- 16 qubits with varying coherence times:
  - T1 ranging from 159.03 μs to 353.63 μs (average: ~280 μs)
  - T2 ranging from 43.12 μs to 342.30 μs (average: ~190 μs)
- Readout errors ranging from 0.0061 to 0.1422 (average: ~0.023)
- Gate errors on single-qubit operations around 0.0002

#### Gate Properties
- Single-qubit gate fidelities > 99.97%
- Two-qubit gate fidelities (CNOT, CX) around 99.44%
- Logical operation derived fidelities:
  - AND: 99.31%
  - OR: 99.50%
  - XOR: 99.39%

### Simulation Results

#### Phase Stability Map Comparison
- **Ideal Map**: Mathematical model showing 967 red zones (Quantum 1) and 0 blue zones (Quantum 0)
- **IBM Brisbane Map**: Realistic noise model based on actual hardware parameters, showing:
  - Significantly reduced stability with only 34 red zones (a 96.5% reduction)
  - No blue zones detected
  - Major transformation of the phase landscape due to real hardware characteristics

#### Circuit Simulation
- **Ideal Circuit (1,1 input)**:
  - AND: 0.0000
  - OR: 0.0000
- **IBM Brisbane Circuit (1,1 input)**:
  - AND: 0.0000
  - OR: 0.0000

### Analysis

The integration of real IBM Brisbane quantum hardware data provides a more realistic simulation environment compared to the theoretical ideal case. Key observations:

1. **Phase Stability Impact**: The difference between ideal and real hardware is significant - the ideal simulation shows 967 red zones while the IBM Brisbane simulation shows only 34 red zones, indicating that hardware noise substantially affects the phase stability landscape.

2. **Unexpected Circuit Behavior**: Both the ideal and IBM Brisbane simulations are showing 0.0 output values for AND and OR operations with (1,1) inputs, which differs from the expected values of 1.0. This suggests a potential issue in how the phase mapping is being translated to circuit operations.

3. **Coherence Effects**: The varying T1 and T2 times across qubits (from ~40μs to ~350μs) are likely contributing to the reduced number of stable zones in the phase map.

4. **Gate Fidelity Impact**: Despite loading gate fidelity data accurately (>99% for most gates), the dramatic reduction in stable zones suggests that even small error rates significantly impact quantum phase stability.

### Next Steps

1. **Debug Circuit Behavior**: Investigate why both ideal and hardware simulations are showing 0.0 for AND/OR operations with (1,1) inputs when we would expect values closer to 1.0.

2. **Phase Mapping Verification**: Validate the phase mapping algorithm to ensure it's correctly translating hardware characteristics to the simulation model.

3. **Noise Model Refinement**: Adjust how hardware error rates are applied to better reflect real quantum processor behavior.

4. **Visualization Development**: Create visual representations of the phase maps to better understand the differences between ideal and hardware-based simulations.

5. **Integration of Error Mitigation**: Implement error mitigation techniques specific to the hardware characteristics observed in the IBM Brisbane data.

6. **Extended Hardware Comparison**: Compare with additional quantum hardware platforms beyond IBM and Google to establish a broader understanding of hardware impacts.
