# Flag Mesh System - What We Built

## System Overview

We have built a production-grade modular feature flagging system with the following characteristics:

- **Modular Architecture**: Each component is self-contained and serves a specific purpose
- **Cryptographic Security**: Zero-Knowledge Proof validation with Merkle trees
- **Redis-based Communication**: Real-time updates using Redis pub/sub
- **YAML Configuration**: Easy to manage feature flag definitions
- **Containerization Support**: Each feature runs in its own container with its own database

## Core Components

### 1. Flag Engine (Go)

The Flag Engine is responsible for:
- Loading feature flag configurations from YAML files
- Managing the state of each feature flag
- Publishing flag states to Redis for consumption by other components
- Providing health monitoring through API endpoints
- Validating feature containers

**Key Features:**
- Real-time configuration updates
- Health monitoring
- Multi-tenancy support
- Compatible with Go 1.13.8

### 2. Router (Go)

The Router handles:
- Routing requests to the appropriate feature containers
- Implementing rollout percentages for gradual feature releases
- Validating feature flag states against Merkle proofs
- Health checking of feature containers
- Load balancing requests

**Key Features:**
- Percentage-based rollouts
- Feature isolation
- Deterministic routing
- Compatible with Go 1.13.8

### 3. Merkle Validator (Go)

The Merkle Validator provides:
- Cryptographic validation of feature flag configurations
- Merkle tree generation for secure proof validation
- Publishing Merkle roots to Redis for verification
- Validation of feature flag integrity

**Key Features:**
- Cryptographic security
- Tamper-proof configurations
- Efficient validation
- Compatible with Go 1.13.8

### 4. YAML Locker (Go)

The YAML Locker handles:
- Creating lock files for configuration integrity
- Integrating Merkle roots into lock files
- Verifying configurations against lock files
- Providing a secure versioning system for configurations

**Key Features:**
- Configuration locking
- Merkle root integration
- Secure versioning
- Compatible with Go 1.13.8

## Security Features

1. **Cryptographic Validation**: Feature flags are validated using Merkle trees, providing cryptographic proof of configuration integrity.

2. **Configuration Locking**: Lock files prevent unauthorized changes to configurations, ensuring that only approved configurations are used.

3. **Rollout Controls**: Percentage-based rollouts allow for gradual feature releases, reducing the risk of problematic deployments.

4. **Health Monitoring**: Active monitoring of feature flags and containers ensures that issues are detected and addressed promptly.

## Technical Achievements

1. **Redis Integration**: Efficient communication between components using Redis pub/sub and key-value storage.

2. **Merkle Tree Implementation**: Custom implementation of Merkle trees for cryptographic validation.

3. **Dynamic Configuration**: Real-time updates to feature flags without system restarts.

4. **Go 1.13.8 Compatibility**: Ensured all components work with Go 1.13.8, addressing compatibility challenges.

5. **Modular Design**: Each component can be deployed, scaled, and updated independently.

## What Makes It Production-Grade

1. **Reliability**: Robust error handling, health monitoring, and fail-safe mechanisms.

2. **Security**: Cryptographic validation, secure versioning, and tamper detection.

3. **Scalability**: Modular design allows for independent scaling of components.

4. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive health endpoints for system monitoring.

5. **Maintainability**: Well-structured code with clear separation of concerns.
