# AirOmega Quantum C++ Engine

A C++ implementation of the AirOmega Quantum framework designed for connecting to real quantum hardware and running quantum tests.

## Overview

The AirOmega Quantum C++ Engine is a powerful framework for quantum computing applications with a focus on:

- Direct connection to real quantum hardware
- Advanced quantum state representation via the Tunnel Tree structure
- Comprehensive testing capabilities for quantum hardware
- Noise resistance analysis and circuit optimization

## Key Components

### Mathematical Utilities
The `airomega_math` module provides essential mathematical functions for quantum calculations, including the omega function, normalization, and classification logic.

### Tunnel Tree Structure
The `tunnel_tree` module implements a tree-based representation of quantum states and transitions, enabling efficient pathfinding through quantum state space.

### Hardware Interface
The `hardware_interface` module defines interfaces for quantum circuits and hardware backends, supporting both simulated environments and real quantum hardware.

### Hardware Testing
The `hardware_tester` module implements methods for testing:
- Gate fidelity
- Decoherence resistance
- Entangled stability
- Noise resilience
