# Secure Financial Data Aggregation System: Logs and Monitoring Guide

## Overview of System Logs

The secure financial data aggregation system maintains several log files to track operations, performance, and security events. Understanding these logs is essential for monitoring system health, troubleshooting issues, and maintaining audit compliance.

## Log File Structure

Logs are stored in the `logs/` directory with the following key files:

```
logs/
├── router1.log     # Router 1 operations and encryption events
├── router2.log     # Router 2 operations and verification events
├── middleware.log  # Orchestration and routing events
├── web-client.log  # Web UI client access logs
└── audit/          # Cryptographic audit logs (proof logs)
    └── audit_log_YYYY-MM-DD.json  # Daily audit logs with cryptographic proofs
```

## Reading and Interpreting Logs

  "merkle_root": "a1b2c3d4e5f6...",
  "zk_proof": "",
  "status": "success",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-10T00:18:48-04:00",
  "details": ""
}
```

Key elements to monitor:
- Success/failure status
- Cryptographic roots for verification
- Timestamps for compliance tracking
- Details field for any failure information

## Using Logs for Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### 1. Real-time Log Monitoring

For real-time monitoring of system activity:

```bash
# Follow all logs in real-time
tail -f logs/*.log

# Monitor specific component (e.g., Router 1)
tail -f logs/router1.log

# Filter for error conditions
grep -i error logs/*.log | tail -f
```

### 2. Security Event Detection

To identify potential security issues:

```bash
# Find Merkle verification failures (critical security event)
grep -i "verification.*fail" logs/router2.log

# Check for unauthorized access attempts
grep -i "unauthorized" logs/*.log

# Monitor authentication failures
grep -i "auth.*fail" logs/*.log
```

### 3. Performance Analysis

For performance optimization:

```bash
# Extract timing information for end-to-end processing
grep -i "completed in" logs/middleware.log | awk '{print $NF}' | sort -n

# Identify slow operations
grep -i "took longer than" logs/*.log

# Find cache performance issues
grep -i "cache" logs/router2.log | grep -i "miss"
```

### 4. Audit Compliance and Reporting

For compliance and audit purposes:

```bash
# Extract daily transaction counts
jq length logs/audit/audit_log_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).json

# Generate summary report of transaction status
jq '.[] | .status' logs/audit/audit_log_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).json | sort | uniq -c

# Extract transactions for a specific bucket ID
jq '.[] | select(.bucket_id=="550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000")' logs/audit/audit_log_*.json
```

## Integrating Logs with External Systems

### 1. Prometheus Metrics Integration

The system already exposes Prometheus metrics at `/metrics` endpoints. To view current metrics:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8081/metrics   # Router 1 metrics
curl http://localhost:8082/metrics   # Router 2 metrics
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics   # Middleware metrics
```

Key metrics to monitor:
- `secure_data_aggregator_requests_total`: Total request count
- `secure_data_aggregator_request_duration_seconds`: Request latency
- `secure_data_aggregator_bucket_size_bytes`: Data volume metrics
- `secure_data_aggregator_cache_hits_total`: Cache performance
- `secure_data_aggregator_audit_log_entries_total`: Audit log entry counts

### 2. ELK Stack Integration

For advanced log analysis, configure Filebeat to ship logs to Elasticsearch:

```yaml
# filebeat.yml example
filebeat.inputs:
- type: log
  enabled: true
  paths:
    - /path/to/secure-data-aggregator/logs/*.log
  tags: ["secure-data-aggregator"]
  json.keys_under_root: true
  json.add_error_key: true

output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["elasticsearch:9200"]
```

### 3. Cloud Logging Integration

For cloud deployments, configure logs for AWS CloudWatch or Google Cloud Logging:

```bash
# Example AWS CloudWatch agent configuration
{
  "logs": {
    "logs_collected": {
      "files": {
        "collect_list": [
          {
            "file_path": "/path/to/secure-data-aggregator/logs/*.log",
            "log_group_name": "secure-data-aggregator",
            "log_stream_name": "{instance_id}-{hostname}-{file_basename}"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Log Retention and Security

For production deployments, implement the following log security practices:

1. **Log Rotation**: Configure automatic rotation with `logrotate`:
   ```
   /path/to/secure-data-aggregator/logs/*.log {
       daily
       missingok
       rotate 90
       compress
       delaycompress
       notifempty
       create 0640 appuser appgroup
   }
   ```

2. **Secure Audit Logs**: Ensure audit logs are immutable and protected:
   ```bash
   # Set appropriate permissions
   chmod 0440 logs/audit/audit_log_*.json
   
   # For critical compliance, consider write-once storage or blockchain backup
   ```

3. **Encryption**: For sensitive environments, encrypt log files:
   ```bash
   # Example using gpg
   cat logs/audit/audit_log_2025-05-10.json | gpg -e -r "security@yourcompany.com" > logs/audit/audit_log_2025-05-10.json.gpg
   ```

## Using Logs for Incident Response

In case of a security incident or data integrity question:

1. **Isolate the affected bucket**:
   ```bash
   grep -i "<bucket-id>" logs/*.log > incident_<bucket-id>.log
   ```

2. **Verify cryptographic proofs**:
   ```bash
   jq '.[] | select(.bucket_id=="<bucket-id>")' logs/audit/audit_log_*.json
   ```

3. **Extract timeline of events**:
   ```bash
   grep -i "<bucket-id>" logs/*.log | sort -k1,2
   ```

4. **Check for tampering evidence**:
   ```bash
   grep -i "verification.*fail.*<bucket-id>" logs/router2.log
   ```

## Log Analysis Best Practices

1. **Regular review**: Schedule daily review of critical error logs
2. **Automated alerts**: Set up alerts for security-critical events (verification failures)
3. **Compliance archiving**: Archive audit logs securely for regulatory compliance
4. **Performance trending**: Track performance metrics over time to identify degradation
5. **Correlation analysis**: Correlate events across different components for root cause analysis
