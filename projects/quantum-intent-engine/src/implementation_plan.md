# Quantum Intent Engine Implementation Plan

We've identified several key areas for enhancement based on your feedback:

## 1. Core System Improvements
- ✅ Added QuantumGateResolver for proper quantum state management
- ✅ Implemented QuantumMeasurement for state collapse and readout
- ✅ Added VQE algorithm implementation for quantum chemistry 

## 2. Implementation Steps Remaining
1. **TensorTree Enhancements**
   - Need to ensure base TensorTree API is compatible with our new components

2. **Build System Updates**
   - Update CMakeLists.txt to include new source files
   - Create single-header version for easier integration

3. **Error Handling & Noise Model**
   - Complete realistic quantum noise simulation
   - Implement error mitigation techniques (QNNEP)

4. **GUI Development**
   - Set up Qt5 dependencies
   - Compile visualization components

## 3. Priority Resolution Plan

1. Fix short-term compilation issues with existing components
2. Create WASM-exportable API for web demos
3. Develop integration tests for the enhanced system
4. Complete Qt5-based visualization for quantum states

The implementation will focus on making the engine both accurate and usable,
suitable for research applications while maintaining the performance characteristics
required for practical quantum simulations.
