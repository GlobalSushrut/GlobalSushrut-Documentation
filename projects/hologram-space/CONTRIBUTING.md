# Contributing to Holographic Torch System

We love your input! We want to make contributing to the Holographic Torch System as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

## Coding Style

* Use consistent indentation (preferably 4 spaces)
* Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
* Comment your code where necessary
* Follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python code
