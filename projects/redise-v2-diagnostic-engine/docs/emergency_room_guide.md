# RediSe v2 Diagnostic Engine: Emergency Room User Guide

## Overview

This guide is designed for healthcare professionals using the RediSe v2 Diagnostic Engine in emergency room settings. The system is optimized for high-pressure environments where rapid, accurate diagnoses can be critical for patient outcomes.

## Quick Start

1. **Patient Triage**: Enter patient symptoms and vital signs as soon as they're available
2. **Review Diagnoses**: Examine confidence scores and evidence for top conditions
3. **View Test Recommendations**: See prioritized tests based on likely conditions
4. **Monitor Treatments**: Track treatment effectiveness in real-time
5. **Generate Reports**: Create comprehensive case documentation with one click

## System Components

The RediSe v2 Diagnostic Engine integrates several specialized modules:

- **SymInject**: Converts patient symptoms into standardized vector representations
- **MTMFA**: Matches symptom vectors to potential diagnoses with confidence scores
- **YAMLGraftor**: Provides evidence-based test recommendations for each diagnosis
- **SimuRiskE**: Projects disease progression and identifies critical treatment windows
- **TreatmentTracker**: Monitors and analyzes treatment effectiveness

## Using the Interface

### Command Line Interface (Quick Access)

For rapid diagnosis during critical situations:

```bash
# Quick diagnosis from symptoms
python3 emergency_diagnosis.py --symptoms "fever:0.8,cough:0.7,shortness_of_breath:0.9"

# Urgent case with patient data
python3 emergency_diagnosis.py --symptoms "chest_pain:0.9,arm_pain:0.8,sweating:0.7" --age 65 --gender male --vitals "bp:170/95,hr:110,o2sat:92"
```

### Streamlit Interface (Visual Dashboard)

For comprehensive case management with visualizations:

1. Launch the interface: `streamlit run frontend/app.py`
2. Use the "Emergency Mode" toggle for streamlined critical case workflow
3. Enter patient information in the simplified emergency form
4. View diagnostic results with visual confidence indicators
5. Monitor risk progression on the timeline visualization
6. Track treatment effectiveness with real-time updates

### API Integration (Hospital Systems)

For integration with existing hospital EMR/EHR systems:

```python
# Quick API call example
import requests

# Emergency diagnostic request
response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/diagnose", json={
    "symptoms": [
        {"description": "chest_pain", "intensity": 0.9},
        {"description": "shortness_of_breath", "intensity": 0.8},
        {"description": "sweating", "intensity": 0.7}
    ],
    "age": 68,
    "gender": "female",
    "vital_signs": {
        "heart_rate": 115,
        "blood_pressure": "175/95",
        "oxygen_saturation": 91
    }
})

# Get diagnoses and recommendations
results = response.json()
```

## Emergency Room Workflow

### 1. Initial Assessment

- Enter chief complaint and triage level
- Record vital signs in the designated fields
- Input observable symptoms with estimated intensity (0.1-1.0)
- Include relevant patient history if available

### 2. Diagnostic Review

- Review the top 3 diagnoses sorted by confidence score
- Examine symptom match percentages for each diagnosis
- Consider differential diagnoses with similar confidence scores
- View supporting evidence for each potential condition

### 3. Test Selection

- Review test recommendations prioritized by diagnostic value
- Note urgency indicators for time-sensitive tests
- Select tests based on availability and patient condition
- Record test orders in the system for tracking

### 4. Treatment Tracking

- Initialize treatment protocols for primary diagnosis
- Record treatment responses as they occur
- Monitor effectiveness trends in real-time
- Receive alerts for critical response thresholds

### 5. Risk Management

- View risk progression timeline for the primary diagnosis
- Identify critical intervention points highlighted on the timeline
- Receive alerts for high-risk progression patterns
- Monitor treatment impact on risk projections

### 6. Documentation

- Generate comprehensive emergency reports with one click
- Include all diagnostic reasoning and evidence
- Document treatment decisions and responses
- Save reports to patient records with severity classification

## Critical Case Features

### Triage Priority Queue

The system automatically prioritizes cases based on:
- Triage level (1-5)
- Risk of rapid deterioration
- Treatment time sensitivity
- Diagnostic certainty

### Treatment Decision Support

For high-acuity cases, the system provides:
- Treatment protocols specific to emergency settings
- Dosing guidelines adjusted for critical care
- Alternative options when first-line treatments are contraindicated
- Real-time effectiveness monitoring

### Team Communication

For complex cases requiring multiple specialists:
- Share diagnostic dashboards with consulting physicians
- Generate targeted reports for specific specialties
- Track diagnostic and treatment timeline across providers
- Maintain consistent documentation across shift changes

## Troubleshooting

### System Issues

- **404 Errors**: If report downloads fail, wait 5-10 seconds and retry
- **Slow Response**: For urgent cases, use command-line interface instead of GUI
- **Connection Issues**: Verify network connectivity to central server

### Clinical Decision Support

- **Low Confidence Scores**: Add additional symptoms or test results to improve accuracy
- **Contradictory Diagnoses**: Review symptom intensities and patient history for inconsistencies
- **Unexpected Recommendations**: Check that patient demographics and medical history are complete

## Resources

- **Training Videos**: Available in the `/docs/videos` directory
- **Sample Cases**: Review emergency case studies in `/examples/emergency`
- **Decision Trees**: Reference diagnostic workflows in `/docs/workflows`
- **Contact Support**: Email technical-support@redise-v2.org for urgent assistance

## Best Practices

1. **Enter data as it becomes available** - Don't wait for complete information
2. **Update symptom intensities** as patient condition changes
3. **Record treatments immediately** to enable real-time effectiveness tracking
4. **Generate reports before shift changes** to ensure continuity of care
5. **Review risk projections hourly** for high-acuity patients

Remember that RediSe v2 is a decision support tool. Always use your clinical judgment and expertise when making treatment decisions.
