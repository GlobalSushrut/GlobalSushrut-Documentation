# Hospital Management System - Integration Tests

This directory contains comprehensive integration tests and validation tools for the Hospital Management System. These tests ensure that all components of the system (frontend, backend, and blockchain) work together seamlessly without contradictions.

## Overview

The integration tests verify:

1. **System-wide Integration**: Testing complete user journeys across frontend, backend, and blockchain
2. **Blockchain Integration**: Verifying that frontend and backend blockchain services interact correctly with the smart contract
3. **System Validation**: Checking for overall system consistency, including UI, API endpoints, and data flow

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- npm (v6+)
- Running backend server (Flask)
- Running frontend server (React)
- Accessible blockchain node (local or testnet)

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Create environment configuration:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Configure your environment variables in `.env`:
   - Set appropriate URLs for services
   - Configure blockchain private keys for testing
   - Set test user credentials

## Running Tests

### All Tests

To run all integration tests at once:

```bash
npm run test:all
```

### Individual Test Suites

You can run specific test suites:

1. **System Integration Tests**:
   Tests complete user journeys and main system functionality:

```bash
npm run test
```

2. **Blockchain Integration Tests**:
   Verifies blockchain functionality across frontend and backend:

```bash
npm run test:blockchain
```

3. **System Validation**:
   Performs comprehensive system validation for consistency:

```bash
npm run test:system
```

## Test Description

### System Integration Test (`system-integration-test.js`)

These tests verify end-to-end functionality including:
- User registration and authentication
- KYC verification workflow
- Medical record creation and retrieval
- Doctor authorization process

### Blockchain Integration Test (`blockchain-integration-test.js`)

These tests focus on blockchain functionality:
- Backend health and status checks
- Direct smart contract interaction verification
- Alignment between frontend and backend blockchain services
- Data consistency between backend APIs and blockchain

### System Validation (`system-validation.js`)

This validation tool checks for:
- Backend API consistency and availability
- UI consistency across different dashboards
- Proper blockchain contract integration
- File structure and code organization
- System health and status

## Troubleshooting

If tests fail, check the following:

1. **Connection Issues**:
   - Ensure all services are running (backend, frontend, blockchain)
   - Verify URLs in `.env` file are correct
   - Check network connectivity between services

2. **Authentication Issues**:
   - Verify test user credentials in `.env` are correct
   - Check JWT token handling in both frontend and backend

3. **Blockchain Issues**:
   - Verify contract address is correct
   - Ensure account has sufficient funds for transactions
   - Check blockchain node connectivity

## Customizing Tests

You can customize test behavior by modifying environment variables:

- `TEST_TIMEOUT_MS`: Adjust timeout for long-running tests
- `SKIP_SERVICE_START`: Skip automatic service startup
- `BLOCKCHAIN_TEST_ONLY`: Run only blockchain tests
- `BACKEND_TEST_ONLY`: Run only backend tests

## Logging and Results

Test logs and results are stored in:

- `integration-tests.log`: Detailed test execution logs
- `./test-results`: Test result summaries and reports

## Achieving 100% Accuracy

To ensure the system operates with 100% accuracy:

1. Run all tests and address any failures
2. Verify system validation passes without issues
3. Check for consistent UI elements across all dashboards
4. Ensure consistent error handling throughout the system
5. Verify consistent data representation between frontend, backend, and blockchain

When all tests pass successfully, you can be confident that the Hospital Management System is functioning with complete accuracy and without contradictions.
